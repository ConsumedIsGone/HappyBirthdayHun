// Full Letter
const letter = `HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY AMAZINGGGGGG RIDDHUUUU!!!

Today is a day that the whole universe should be celebrating, because it’s the day my favoritest person was born (any guesses who?). Having you in my life feels like living in a permanent springtime, (that's if spring was the best cause winter is clearly better)—everything is just brighter, softer, and so much more beautiful when I’m with you.

You are my absolute sunshine, my softest place to land, and the person who makes my heart do a little happy dance every single time you smile. Even though I may not always say it out loud and just stare at you instead, there’s not a moment that passes where I don’t admire the beautiful and whole hearted person you are and how much I just love you.

You deserve literally the world, all 4/3*6371*6371*6371*22/7 m^3 of it. (I’m sorry for a physics joke) 

This letter cannot do any justice to how much I love you and how much I keep falling deeper into this rabbit hole of love each day I get to spend with you. The dictionary literally does not have words for how stunning of a person you are, both inside and out. You are genuinely the best person in my life and I really wish I could fulfill every wish of yours.

I mean SERIOUSLY, you’ve been making my life funnier and full of twists for almost 3 years at this point. Without you, my life would be unsalted like your jokes WHICH ARE TOTALLY NOT FUNNYYY (im not appealing to ur ego just cause its ur bday). But in all seriousness, every time you act sassy and do that funny head bob of yours saying “Who’s the best? I AM!” I could literally hug you so hard that you turn into pulp 😅.

Also, please try to act surprised when you open the rest of your gift. I know I’m about as subtle as a firework when it comes to keeping secrets, but I really tried my best this time. Even if you’ve already guessed what it is, just give me that cute "WOW YOU’RE THE BEST TANMAY” reaction when you read this that makes my heart melt. You’re another year older, but don’t worry—you still don’t look a day over "RIDICULOUSLY ADORABLE AND HOT AND CUTE AND AND RAVISHING AND SO SO PRETTY AND ANGELIC AND AND GORGEOUS AND SO SO SO SO IRRESISTABLE ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO NOT KISS YOUUUUU OMG” years old.

I want to spend today (and every day after) making sure you feel like the most cherished person on the planet because u got me and I’ll NEVERRR stop CHERISHINGG UUUU. You deserve the world wrapped in a pink ribbon, but for now, I’m sending you all my love, a thousand kisses, and a promise to always be your biggest fan.

Happy Birthday, my angel. I love you more than words can say!
Forever yours,
Tanmay`;
